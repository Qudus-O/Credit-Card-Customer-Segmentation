# Credit-Card-Customer-Segmentation

In this Project, a data scientist working for a credit card company. The dataset contains information about the companyâ€™s clients and you're asked to help segment them into different groups in order to apply different business strategies for each type of customer.

For instance, the company could provide higher credit limits for customers that use the card a lot, but spend little money, or even create incentives for those with high income who don't use the card as much as the company expects. In order to apply different strategies, the company needs different groups of customers.

Luckily, the data engineering team has already cleaned most of the data so we can focus on building the best possible model to segment the data. Also, in a planning meeting with the Data Science coordinator, it was decided that we should use the K-means algorithm to segment the data.
The company expects to receive a group for each client and an explanation of the characteristics of each group and the main points that make them different.

In order to use the algorithm properly and achieve all the goals that the company has set for us, we'll go through the following steps:

- Analyze the dataset;
- Prepare the data for modeling;
- Find an appropriate number of clusters;
- Segment the data;
- Interpret and explain the results.
